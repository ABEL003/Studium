ALL DRAWINGS ARE IN METRIC MEASUREMENTS1. ALL ENGINEERING PRACTICES SHALL BE APPLIED WITH REGARDS TO HOLE AND SHAFT TOLERANCES.2. WHERE SCREWS OR BOLTS ARE USED THE CLEARANCE HOLES SHALL BE APPROXIMATELY 5% TO 8% LARGER THAN THE MATCHING TAPPED HOLE.3. PREFERABLY ALL TAPPED HOLES AND MATCHING SCREWS AND/OR BOLTS TO BE METRIC FINE (MF)4. MATERIALS SPECIFIED ON THE DRAWINGS ARE INDICATIVE ONLY. THE BUILDER CAN MAKE HIS/HER OWN MATERIAL CHOICE.5. ALL CONNECTIONS/JOINTS WHICH HAVE STEAM PRESSURE APPLIED TO IT SHALL BE SILVER/HARD SOLDERED.6. COMPRESSION SPRINGS ARE DRAWN IN COMPRESSED STATE (CP), UNCOMPRESSED STATE IS APPROX 40% TO 60% LONGER THEN COMPRESSED STATE.7. WHERE PREFERRED SCREW OR RIVETED CONNECTIONS CAN BE OMITTED AND PARTS CAN BE BONDED TOGETHER BY USING EITHER HIGH STRENGTH GLUE, EPOXY RESIN, OR SOLDER.8. PARTS WHICH ARE DIRECTLY EXPOSED TO STEAM AND/OR WATER SHOULD BE CONSTRUCTED USING NON-FERROUS OR NON CORROSIVE MATERIAL SUCH AS BRASS, BRONZE, GUNMETAL, STAINLESS STEEL, COPPER OR MONEL.9. THE ORDER IN WHICH THE PARTS/COMPONENTS ARE MANUFACTURED AND THE MODEL IS ASSEMBLED IS ENTIRELY LEFT TO THE BUILDER/MODEL MAKER.10. A COLOUR SCHEME FOR THIS PROJECT IS ENTIRELY LEFT UP TO THE MODEL MAKER.11. THE MANNER IN WHICH THE PARTS/COMPONENTS ARE MANUFACTURED IS ENTIRELY LEFT UP TO THE BUILDER.12. USE LOCTITE, ON SCREW OR PRESS FIT CONNECTIONS OR SURFACES, WERE DEEMED NECESSARY TO PREVENT PARTS FROM LOOSENING. XX.
