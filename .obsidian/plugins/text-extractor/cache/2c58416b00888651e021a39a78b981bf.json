Work relationships are built and dropped easily, based on the practicality of the situation. You do good work consistently, you are reliable, I enjoy working with you, I trust you.” “trust is built trough sharing meals, evening drinks, and visits at the coffee machine. Work relationships build up slowly over the long term. I´ve seen who you are at the deep level. I´ve shared personal time with you, I know others well who trust you, I trust you.” Building trust Example 1: Gerdau merger Example 2: Nestle acquisition\t Guannxi: “translates loosely as personal connections, relationships or social networks” Building trust from a task-based country: build a personal relationship spending time with the person, talking about personal information gifting presents Building trust from a relationship-based country: accept the lack of personal discussions be as efficient as possible peach vs. coconut cultures https://pngfre.com/wp-content/uploads/peach-png-image-from-pngfre-33-1024x815.png https://i.pinimg.com/originals/dd/3f/8f/dd3f8f13aecf1c3e441facf64961423f.png Possible communication devices & when to utilise them In task-based societies: the most efficient way is the best way One can use email, telephone or meetings, whatever suits the occasion best In relationship-oriented countries: choose the most personal type of communication possible Instead of emailing someone, one can take the phone, or best meet them personally.

Wasta may lead to unjust practices by favoring nepotism and excluding those that deserve an opportunity for those lacking strong personal connections Wasta can contribute to corrupt practices, as personal relationships are used to gain illegitimate advantages Full Dependence on Wasta can result in social division, as those without strong connections may be disadvantaged, leading to a divide between different social strata.
