Moreover, elite gamer groups with ﬁnancial in-game-investments co-ﬁnance all users of free-to-play-games. Besides questions on youth protection, the growing popularity of free-to-play games has fostered discussions on supposed associations to Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD). Method: Children and adolescents using free-to-play browser games were examined in a German school- based representative study (N = 3967; age range 12 to 18). Based on a clinical self-report AICA-S (Wölﬂing et al., 2011), students were categorized into non-problematic, risky, and addicted users. Psycho-social problems (SDQ; Goodman, 1997), perceived stress (PSS; Cohen, Kamarck & Mermelstein, 1983), coping strategies (BriefCOPE; Carver, 1997), and Average Revenue per (Paying) User (ARPU) were investigated as dependent variables. Furthermore, an industry classiﬁcation (Freeloaders, Minnows, Dolphins, and Whales) for free-to-play gamers was used for additional relations regarding IGD, SDQ, PSS, BriefCOPE, and ARPU. Results: Among free-to-play gamers the prevalence of IGD amounted to 5.2%. Subjects classiﬁed with IGD displayed higher psycho-social symptoms than non-problematic users, reported higher degrees of per- ceived stress, and applied dysfunctional coping strategies more frequently. Additionally, we found a higher ARPU among subjects with IGD. Conclusion: ARPU is signiﬁcantly associated with IGD. Whales share signiﬁcant characteristics with addicted video gamers; Dolphins might be classiﬁed as risky consumers; Minnows and Freeloaders are rather non- pathological gamers. Vulnerability for stress, dysfunctional coping, and free-to-play gaming represent an unhealthy combination. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction The implementation of monetarization strategies has changed traditional game design. Today, free-to-play monetarization mechanisms are considered and implemented as core features of on- line video games. According to Lovell (2011) gamers with high ﬁnan- cial performance (20€ [Average Revenue Per (Paying) User]) per month are commonly addressed as Whales (10% of payers). Gamers spending around 5€ are considered as Dolphins (40% of payers). Gamers spending around 1€ are considered as Minnows (50% of payers). Non-spenders are classiﬁed as Freeloaders. Whales signiﬁ- cantly co-ﬁnance all users of free-to-play games and realize rentable business models for video game publishers (cf. Lovell, 2011).

Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Addictive Behaviors journal h o mepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/addictbeh their play some Whales even spend copious ﬁve-ﬁgure amounts of money on the game (Rose, 2013). Within the last years a growing body of literature has emerged dealing with Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD). IGD is characterized by loss of con- trol, preoccupation with game-related contents, tolerance, withdrawal, and continued use despite negative repercussions (e.g. APA, 2013). Since there is a growing evidence that IGD has to be perceived as a severe health issue that has adverse effects in many ways (e.g. social withdrawal, deteriorating achievements, decreasing psychological well-being, depres- sion, and impairment of psychosocial functioning; e.g. Müller, Beutel & Wölﬂing, 2014; Kuss & Grifﬁths, 2012) the American Psychiatric Associa- tion (APA) decided to include it as a preliminary mental disorder within the DSM-5 (APA, 2013). Within adolescence, prevalence of IGD is estimat- ed to amount to 2–4% (e.g. Müller et al., 2015) with higher rates in some Asian countries (e.g. Mak et al., 2014). Previous research indicated that especially MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games) are associated with IGD (Kuss, Louws, & Wiers, 2012; Lam, 2014; Stetina, Kothgassner, Lehenbauer, & Kryspin-Exner, 2011). However, supposing that monetarization strategies are creating consumer commitment towards the game, it is reasonable to assume that also free-to-play games might bear an addictive potential. 1.1. Research questions and hypothesis Since free-to-play games are receiving growing popularity, we ﬁrstly were interested in knowing more about who is playing this kind of video games. Thus we want to provide a detailed demographic descrip- tion of free-to-play game users. Applying monetarization strategies in online games is a popular way to enhance the gamers' commitment to the game. At the same time, creating commitment was shown to be as- sociated with an increased risk for developing excessive and addictive use (e.g. Hsu, Wen, & Wu, 2009; Tone, Zhao, & Yan, 2014). In contrast to previous studies that have focused on relationships between IGD and MMORPGs, we were interested in exploring the prevalence of IGD and risky use among adolescent users of free-to-play games. Further- more, we were interested in providing a detailed characterization of these children and adolescents meeting criteria for IGD. In order to allow for comparisons to the characteristics found in previous research, we deﬁned psychosocial symptoms, perceived stress, and coping strat- egies as dependent variables. In accordance with previous ﬁndings based on samples not speciﬁcally using free-to-play games, we expect- ed to ﬁnd a higher degree of psychosocial symptoms associated with IGD and higher levels of distress (e.g. Müller et al., 2015; Gentile et al., 2011) as well as a preponderance of dysfunctional coping styles (e.g. Batthyány, Müller, Benker, & Wölﬂing, 2009; see also Kuss & Grifﬁths, 2012). As a secondary aim, we investigated differences of ﬁnancial in- vestments for video games depending on the clinical classiﬁcation of gaming behavior. We expect to ﬁnd that subjects meeting the diagnostic criteria for IGD will spend higher amounts of money for the game than healthy regular users. 2. Methods 2.1. Subjects and recruitment A total of 4.047 students aged 12 to 18 years from secondary and vo- cational schools in Germany participated. The sample was drawn ac- cording to representative standards (stratiﬁed regarding region and population density). Participating schools were randomly selected from all secondary schools of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Random selection identiﬁed 62 schools, whereof 41 consented participation in the survey. Informed consent and information letters were circulated in selected classes and signed by pupils' parents and the pupils. Eighty-six point ﬁve percent of requested students participated. The study was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local ethics committee. 80 cases had to be eliminated due to missing values leading to a sample of 3.967 children and adolescents. From these, we extracted a subsample of n = 1.485 (37.4%) subjects reporting to have at least some experience using free-to-play (browser) games (ﬁlter item: “Which of the following computer games do you use … browser-games”; 0 = never, 1 = seldom, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4= very often). 3. Measures 3.1. Assessment for internet and computer game addiction (AICA-S; Wölﬂing, Müller, & Beutel, 2011) AICA-S is a clinical self-report measure to classify internet behavior into non-problematic (0.0–6.5 points), risky (7.0–13.0 points), and ad- dictive usage (N 13.0 points). Its 14 items are closely related to those re- cently published within the DSM-5, covering preoccupation, tolerance, loss of control, withdrawal etc. Its cutoffs ﬁrstly were derived from a community-based sample and furthermore validated in a clinical sam- ple of treatment seekers (Müller, Beutel, et al., 2014). By applying the rating of psychotherapists on the severity of addictive behavior as an ex- ternal criterion, AICA-S yielded good diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity: 80.5%; speciﬁcity: 82.4%; Müller, Beutel, et al., 2014). Psychometric properties of AICA-S have been successfully evaluated within clinical samples and representative populations (Müller, Glaesmer, Brähler, et al., 2014). In this survey Cronbach's Alpha amounted to .82. 3.2. Strengths and difﬁculties questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 1997) The SDQ is a clinical questionnaire for adolescents encompassing 25 items. It assesses psychosocial symptoms on ﬁve subscales: Emotional problems (Cronbach's Alpha of α = .72), behavioral disorders (Cronbach's Alpha of α = .53), hyperactivity and concentration difﬁcul- ties (Cronbach's Alpha of α = .65), problems with peers (Cronbach's Alpha of α = .49) and prosocial behavior (Cronbach's Alpha of α = .69). The instrument is commonly-used in the international research and has good psychometric properties. Beyond reported Cronbach's Alpha for each subscale, the global SDQ score in this study displays a Cronbach's Alpha of α =.59. 3.3. Perceived stress scale (PSS; Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983) It is a 10-item inventory, which is used for the assessment of subjec- tive perceived stress and a general vulnerability for stress. It is a mea- sure, which classiﬁes appraised stressful life events. In this survey, we found a Cronbach´s Alpha of α = .76. 3.4. BriefCOPE (Carver, 1997) The BriefCOPE is a widely used self-report assessing 14 different cop- ing strategies on 28 items (on a 4-point Likert-scale, 1 = I haven't been doing this at all; 4 = I've been doing this a lot). In our study, we used an adapted version consisting of the coping strategies Self-Distraction (Cronbach's Alpha of α = .45), Active Coping (Cronbach's Alpha of α = .49), Positive Reframing (Cronbach's Alpha of α = .52), Denial (Cronbach's Alpha of α = .61), Self-Blame (Cronbach's Alpha of α = .75), and Behavioral Disengagement (Cronbach's Alpha of α =.62). Prior studies reported media-focused coping as a common coping mechanism of Internet Addicts (Batthyány et al., 2009; Wölﬂing & Müller, 2009). Thus, we additionally created two items (e.g. “Itried to forget about the problem by watching television, surﬁng the internet or playing computer games”) assessing media use as another form of coping with stressful events (Media-Related Coping; Cronbach's Alpha of α =.85). 329M. Dreier et al. / Addictive Behaviors 64 (2017) 328–333 3.5. Average revenue per user (ARPU) [per month] The amount of money that was spent for free-to-play browser games per month was measured via self-report. Categories were 0€,1–5€,6– 15€,16–25€ and more than 25€ (open category). Inspired by Lovell (2011) adeﬁnition for Freeloaders, Minnows, Dolphins, and Whales was undertaken. Thus, gamers, who spent 0€ were considered as Free- loaders. Gamers, who spent 1–5€ were considered as Minnows. Those who spent 6–15€ were considered as Dolphins, and persons who spent more than 16€ were classiﬁed as Whales. 3.6. Data analysis All the analyses were conducted using SPSS 22.0 and were based solely on those subjects that reported to have ever used free-to-play games (n = 1.485). Beside general descriptive analyses, chi-square- tests and t-tests were conducted for analyzing group-differences with Cohens d as a measure of effect sizes. Hierarchic linear regression anal- yses were applied to analyze complex relationships. For the prevalence rates, 95% conﬁdence intervals are reported. 4. Results 4.1. Demographic features of adolescent free-to-play-users Firstly, we analyzed demographic variables associated with free-to- play game use. Among those subjects reporting to use free-to-play games, 45.5% were female (n = 676; age: M = 15.57; SD = 1.68) and 54.5% male (n = 809, age: M = 15.53; SD = 1.64). Most of the users vis- ited vocational (28.7%) and grammar schools (27.1%), followed by mid- dle school (21.0%), middle school plus (8.1%), secondary modern school (3.3%), and integrated school (1.8%). The majority of free-to-play game users was 17 years old (22.0%), followed by 19.9% who were 16 years old, 17.0% aged 14 years, 16.1% aged 15 years, and 12.3% aged 18 years. Lower usage rates were found for the age groups 13 years (9.0%) and 12 years (3.8%). 4.2. Prevalence of internet gaming disorder among free-to-play game users In a second step, we estimated the prevalence of IGD in association with the use of free-to-play games. According to AICA-S 5.2% (n = 77, CI-95 = 4.0–6.3%) of the sample were classiﬁed with IGD and 17.4% (n = 259; CI-95 = 15.6–19.5%) were meeting some criteria for IGD and consequently labeled as risky users. No signiﬁcant differences were found for gender with 5.7% of the boys being classiﬁed with IGD and 4.6% of the girls (χ 2(2) = 1.32, p =.523). Table 1 depicts gender- and age-speciﬁc differences in IGD, risky, and non-problematic use. To explore if the frequency of using free-to-play games is associated with different prevalence-rates for IGD, we conducted a chi-square-test that yielded a signiﬁcant effect (χ2(6) = 114.13, p b .001). The IGD- prevalence was highest among those using free-to-play games “very often” (17.1%; n = 32), followed by those using it “often” (7.0%, n = 19), “sometimes” (3.6%, n = 15), and “seldom” (1.8%, n = 11). 4.3. Differences in psychosocial symptoms, perceived stress, and coping Symptom severity is signiﬁcantly increased according to the IGD classiﬁcation. Medium to high effect sizes is reported in terms of the global SDQ score as well as its subscales “emotional problems”, “behav- ioral problems”,and “peer problems”.The subscales “hyperactivity” and “prosocial behavior” are statistically less associated with IGD (Table 2). Perceived stress is signiﬁcantly contrasting the IGD groups with me- dium to strong effect sizes. Capabilities to handle stressful life events are signiﬁcantly linked to a non-clinical classiﬁcation of IGD. This is indicat- ed by small effect sizes for active coping. Medium to strong effect sized is reported for all sub-dimensions. Media-focused coping shows the strongest effect sizes (Table 3). Additionally, a hierarchic linear regression analysis was conducted with the AICA-S-score as the criterion and the SDQ-Global Problem Score, PSS-score, and the seven coping strategies as predictors, and con- trolled for age and gender. Before running the analyses, statistical pre- conditions were checked (e.g. heteroscedasticity and curvilinear relations). A signiﬁcant model was found (p b .001, R2 = .282) with SDQ-Global Problem Score (β =.25, p b .001), and the coping strategies resignation (β =.09, p b .001), media related coping (β = .28, p b .001), and PSS-score (β =.06,p b .001). Other coping styles were not signiﬁ- cantly associated with the increment of the AICA-S score. 4.4. Relationships between ﬁnancial investments and clinical classiﬁcation of gaming behavior ARPU differences were tested for AICA-S group differences. The amount of money spent online signiﬁcantly allows for a clinical classiﬁ- cation of free-to-play use. However, relevant effect sizes are reported for the group difference of risky to addicted, and from non-problematic to addicted players (Table 4). The Lovell inspired classiﬁcation of Freeloaders (0€/month), Min- nows (1–5€/month), Dolphins (6–15€/month), and Whales (more than 16€/month) is further tested for signiﬁcance and gender differ- ences. Chi-Square testing for AICA-S scores and the group allocation (Freeloader, Minnows, Dolphins, and Whales) reports a signiﬁcance level of p = .013. Further, signiﬁcant gender differences (p b .001) Table 2 Symptom severity of free-to-play gamers according to clinical classiﬁcation of computer gaming behavior.

Dreier et al. / Addictive Behaviors 64 (2017) 328–333 were reported (Table 5). Age differences were also Chi-Square tested, but were not signiﬁcant (p = .605). 5. Discussion In this study, we were interested in learning more about relation- ships between the use of free-to-play-games and Internet Gaming Dis- order. To that purpose a large sample of children and adolescents reporting to be experienced in using these games was examined. With 37%, a large part of the representative sample of children and adoles- cents had experience in using free-to-play bowser games. Interestingly, comparable rates of boys and girls were found here. Regarding the prev- alence of IGD, we found that a substantial proportion of these subjects met clinical criteria for IGD. The prevalence of 5.2% meeting those criteria is higher than reported in other surveys without explicitly dif- ferentiating the use of speciﬁc computer game genres (e.g. Rehbein, Kleimann, & Mößle, 2010; Müller et al., 2015). Interestingly, in contrast to prior ﬁndings, we found no gender differences among those adoles- cents classiﬁed with IGD. However, this has to be understood as a pre- liminary ﬁnding in need of further validation since it was not possible to control for effects of the use of multiple computer game genres. Additionally, we investigated correlates of IGD among free-to-play gamers. Comparing adolescents with non-problematic, risky, and addicted use of free-to-play games revealed that meeting the diagnostic criteria for IGD was associated with more severe psychosocial symp- toms in any of the SDQ-subscales. The highest effect sizes were found for Behavioral Problems (difﬁculties regarding impulse control and in- terpersonal conﬂicts), Hyperactivity (problems regarding attention and goal prosecution), and Emotional Problems (feelings of depression and anxiety). In so far, our results are matching prior ﬁndings on adoles- cents with Internet Addiction and Internet Gaming Disorder (Cao & Su, 2006; Jang, Hwang, & Choi, 2008; Müller et al., 2015). However, to our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst survey explicitly addressing symptoms of IGD and associated psychopathology related to the use of free-to- play games. While the addictive potential of using MMORPGs has been demonstrated before (Kuss et al., 2012; Lam, 2014; Stetina et al., 2011), our results emphasize that also free-to-play games might be regarded as a potential health-related issue. As hypothesized we found that IGD was related to a higher level of perceived stress and to speciﬁc coping strategies. The comparison between non-problematic and addicted gamers revealed that especially Media-Related Coping, Denial, Self-Distraction, Self-Blame, and Behavioral Disengagement were coping strategies prevailing among the IGD-group. Additionally, Active Coping and Positive Reframing were expressed less frequently as a reaction towards stressful events. With regard to the regression analysis conducted, Media-Related Coping and Behavioral Disengagement remained as predictors for IGD. These ﬁndings conﬁrm prior results and also validate assumptions of proposed models dealing with preconditions for exhibiting internet and computer game addiction (e.g. Davis, 2001; Dreier, Wölﬂing, & Müller, 2013; Dong & Potenza, 2014; Brand, Young, & Laier, 2014). These results also indicate potential starting points for prevention and intervention programs, e.g. by implementing preventive (school-based) stress management pro- grams and techniques for cognitive restructuring in treatment programs. As hypothesized the amount of money spent in free-to-play games is signiﬁcantly linked to the IGD-classiﬁcation. Indeed, we found signiﬁ- cant associations here with a substantial percentage of children and ad- olescents meeting criteria for IGD being classiﬁed as “Whales”. Interestingly, these subjects spend the highest amounts of money and time on the game. In the light of growing mobile access and usage by children and ad- olescents it is reasonable to assume that there is a decreasing threshold for making ﬁnancial transactions (e.g. via mobile payments and prepaid cards; e.g. Roberts, Yaya, & Manolis, 2014). This may lead to various ad- verse consequences: Firstly, minors are running the risk of losing track of their ﬁnancial situation and – in the worst case – are incurring debts. Secondly, as has been mentioned before, monetarization strate- gies in free-to-play games are thought to increase the gamer's commit- ment towards the game and therefore might be fostering the risk for an addictive use in the long run. Especially the capability of solving problematic in-game situation by spending money might be linked to the coping mechanisms of vul- nerable free-to-play gamers. A problematic situation can be answered by ﬁnancial investments. This opportunity supports the vulnerable gamer's attitude to escape problems by applying media-focused coping strategies. This is especially relevant in terms of conditioning processes, which lead to a cognitive bias and severe attachment on the game.

Dreier et al. / Addictive Behaviors 64 (2017) 328–333 longer this kind of behavior is maintained the more likely it is that spe- ciﬁc dynamics develop, which eventually might lead to a problematic or even addictive use. In terms of common theories on internet addiction, this is especially relevant since dysfunctional coping has been reported to play a key role in developing Internet Gaming Disorder (Brand et al., 2014; Müller, Beutel, Egloff and Wölﬂing, 2014). Unsatisfying moments, which would have led gamers of traditional video games to quit or change the game, are now designed essentials of the game. Thus, a higher degree of self-efﬁcacy is persuaded, since striding the paywall solves lots of in-game problems. Individuals suffering from Internet Gaming Disorder are commonly showing a decreased self-efﬁcacy (Jeong & Kim, 2010; Wölﬂing et al., 2011; Festl, Scharkow, & Quandt, 2013), which might make those even more attracted by free-to-play mechanics. There are some aspects limiting the generalizability of our ﬁndings. A clear limitation regards the conceptualization of browser games as free-to-play games. In 2011 when the representative survey was launched there was no non-free-to-play browser game that was com- monly played in Germany. Nonetheless, the conceptualization of free- to-play gamers in general has its limitations based on the framing, which was used in the operationalization. Further research for the meta-concept of free-to-play games regarding different genres would be desirable for future investigations. The calculation with this subsam- ple resulted in a small group of adolescents and children suffering from IGD, which has to be considered in the evaluation of our results. Addi- tionally, the BriefCOPE subscales Self-Distraction (α = .45) and Active Coping (α = .49) pointed to an unsatisfactory internal reliability. Be- sides, the subscale Positive Reframing (α = .52) showed poor Cronbach's Alpha values. Thus, a validation for our adapted BriefCOPE is required. Furthermore, since our ﬁndings are based on a cross- sectional design, it is not possible to draw conclusions regarding the causality of the associations found. For future research it is desirable to take a closer look at the speciﬁc genre of free-to-play games and to con- solidate our preliminary ﬁndings. 6. Conclusion It has been indicated that free-to-play games are highly associated with IGD. Based on our ﬁndings it is evident to talk about healthy Min- nows, at risk Dolphins, and addicted Whales. Subjects being at risk of suffering from IGD are more likely to spend higher amounts of money, are less prosocial in terms of behavior, are affected by problems of con- duction as well as hyperactivity, and are having problems with peers or within relationships. The degree of psychosocial distress reported by them is signiﬁcantly increased and they are less likely to face problems by applying functional coping strategies. Additionally, the design of free-to-play games transports the feeling of self-efﬁcacy. We found some evidence that the use of free-to-play games is related to both in- creased risk of meeting criteria for IGD and willingness for ﬁnancial in-game-investments. Therefore, strategies preventing (vulnerable) in- dividuals from negative repercussions potentially arising from free-to- play-use (e.g. IGD, debts) should be considered. It is plain to see that the problematic nature of monetarization designs in video games de- mands the development and implementation of speciﬁc countermea- sures guaranteeing youth protection and prevention of developing IGD.
